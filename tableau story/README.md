Old dashboard: udacity New Flights delay | Tableau Public
New story instead: udacity story Flights delay | Tableau Public
Summary:
• In this story we first see in general which airline has the most delay in general just to get the big 
picture.
• Then take a deeper look on where the most delay happen and what type of delays contributes 
to each airline?
• Investigating what are the reasons for cancelation of flights and which one contributed the most 
to each airline as it related also to the delays, cancelations don’t happen just like that.
• Lastly, what time of the year an airline has the highest and lowest delays?
to “avoid it” in that time and see another airline or wait for your airline if you have a discount or 
something similar.
As an example, AS airline in the fourth month has the lowest delay along the year so you could 
travel with it. But in August the delay is the highest you should avoid it if time matters.
Design:
• I chose normal bar charts as it just categorical data with sum simplicity beats here other charts
show who has the highest total delay. The color embeddings are not necessary, so it’s removed
• I chose stacked bar charts as they show who has the highest delay and how each type of delay 
contribute to the aggregated delay and the color encoding to differentiate between them.
And a separated bars making the answer simpler for me.
• I chose a tree map chart as it shows how each type of cancelations reasons has contributed to 
the sum of cancelations in each and every airline. A pie chart for simplicity to see the sum of the 
cancelation’s reasons. Color encoding to differentiate as they are separate, we did go with blue, 
orange, and purple, didn’t combine red and green to ensure if a color blind can differentiate 
between the colors.
• I chose normal bar charts as it just categorical data with sum simplicity beats here other charts 
show who has the highest total delay. The color embeddings are not necessary, so it’s removed
And for the second chart, I chose line chart as it is the best choice to show how a trend change 
with time.

Feedback: 
• Try not to make all the charts bar charts -> replace some with pie and tree map
• Use filters across the dashboard- > done
• You must ensure that a dashboard is included that contains multiple worksheets- >done
• Make a story instead of a single dashboard -> done
• In drawing months, please make sure that the labels are from 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 13 -
>done
• Instead of using the letters A , B , and C as cancellation reasons, please translate that 
for your audience by listing out what those values mean instead -> done
• A title is important to communicate the purpose of the graph, ensuring that we are 
making the right interpretations with the data. Please make sure that each visualization 
has a clear and descriptive title at the top. -> done
